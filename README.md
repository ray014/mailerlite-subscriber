## Here are step-by-step instructions to run a PHP project on a local environment with PHP 7.4, MySQL 5.x, and the latest version of the Chrome browser:

- Install a local server: To run a PHP project on your local environment, you need to install a local server like XAMPP, WAMP, or MAMP. These local servers come with pre-installed software like Apache, MySQL, and PHP. You can download and install any of these local servers from their official websites.

- Install PHP 7.4: Once you have installed a local server, you need to make sure that PHP 7.4 is installed. Most of the latest versions of the local servers come with PHP 7.4 pre-installed. However, if you don't have PHP 7.4, you can download and install it from the official PHP website.

- Install MySQL 5.x: You also need to make sure that MySQL 5.x is installed on your local environment. If you have installed a local server like XAMPP, WAMP, or MAMP, then MySQL 5.x should already be installed. However, if you don't have MySQL 5.x, you can download and install it from the official MySQL website.

- Import the database: After installing MySQL, you need to import the database for your project. You can do this by using a tool like phpMyAdmin, which comes with most local servers. Open phpMyAdmin, import the database using sql/mailerlite_subscriber.sql.

- Download and extract your project: Next, download your PHP project and extract it into the "htdocs" or "www" folder of your local server. This folder should be located in the installation directory of your local server.

- Configure your project: Once your project is extracted, you need to configure it. Open the configuration file of your project and make sure that the database credentials match the credentials of the database you created in step 4.

- Run your project: Run your laravel project using artisan command 'php artisan serve'.

- Open your project in the browser: After configuring your project, open the latest version of the Chrome browser and enter the URL of your project in the address bar. If everything is configured correctly, your project should run without any issues.
